# Conference switching modeler

I seek to model how people bounce around a conference depending on the quality of the talks that they attend. I model this as a quantum square well with the following assumptions:
    
- Conference attendees are modeled as electrons who are bound to be within several wells with finite height.
- Good talks decrease the kinetic energy of all electrons in the site
- Bad talks increase the kinetic energy of all electrons in the site
- Conference attendees can tunnel to neighboring sites with varying probabilities based on their energies
- In advanced models, particles with greater masses will have less likelyhood of tunneling. This represents conference attendees with greater amounts of patience, or a greater resistance to switching rooms

If you would like to expand on this model or potentially publish an article, please let me know.

Note: several bugs currently exist within this code. This is not a working simulation yet
